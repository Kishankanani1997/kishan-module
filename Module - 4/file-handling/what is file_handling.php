    FILE HANDLING:- File Handling in php is used to
    - open file
    - read file
    - write file
    - create file
    - fetch file
    - read only file
    - write only file
    - read/write file
    - delete file

    PHP uses some function for file handling such as :-
    1. fopen()
    2. fread()
    3. fwrite()
    4. fgets()

    PHP uses some mode to read/write a file:-
    r=>  read only file
    r+=> read/wrie a file
    w=>  write only but if file does not exist create's new file
    w+=> read/write a file but if file does not exist create's a new file
