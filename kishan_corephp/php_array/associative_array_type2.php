            ASSOCIATIVE ARRAY:- Associative arrays are arrays that use named keys that you assign to them.

    There are two ways to create an associative array: 

    (1ST type)
    $age = array("Peter"=>"35", "Ben"=>"37", "Joe"=>"43");
    
    or:
    (2nd Type)
    $age['Peter'] = "35";
    $age['Ben'] = "37";
    $age['Joe'] = "43";
*/

    // $fruit=array("Mango"=>"Yellow","Strawberry"=>"Red","Coconut"=>"Green","Guava"=>"Pink");
    // print_r($fruit);

    $fruit['mango']="yellow";
    $fruit['coconut']="green";
    $fruit['cherry']="blue";

    print_r($fruit);
