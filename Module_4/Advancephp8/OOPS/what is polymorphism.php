    POLYMORPHISM:-Polymorphism in OOPs is a concept that allows you to create classes with different functionalities in a single interface.
    
    it is of two types: 1. Compile-time (overloading)
                        2. Run time (overriding)
                        
    But polymorphism in PHP does not support overloading / compile-time polymorphism.
